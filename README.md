---
A simple experiment of IGW exploration (this implementation is also known as SquareCB in \[1\]) and CappedIGW \[2\]

To run this experiment: 
1. Execute `experiment1.py`, `experiment2.py`, and `experiment3.py` to produce log files.
2. Use `analysis.ipynb` to create plots from the experimental logs.
